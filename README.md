## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to the Roller Coaster Data Analysis project!
The goal of this project was to explore a dataset containing information about roller coasters worldwide and extract meaningful insights about their design, performance, and historical trends.

Using data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we uncover key factors influencing roller coaster evolution over time.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights

- **Coaster Introductions**: Peaks during the 1990s and early 2000s.
- **Speed Distribution**: Most coasters run between 30-70 mph.
- **Speed vs Height**: Taller coasters tend to be faster.
- **Coaster Types**: Steel coasters generally outperform wooden ones in speed and height.
- **Correlations**: Moderate positive relationships among speed, height, inversions, and g-force.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Roller coaster designs show strong ties between height and speed.
- Steel coaster dominance began during the 90s.
- Despite correlations, coaster design involves complex trade-offs.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Regional analysis by country or continent.
- Predictive modeling for coaster specifications.
- Time series analysis of coaster evolution.
